Module 19 Homework Challenge
### Original Code from M19_Starter_Code under Module 19 Challenge
#### 
#### I followed the examples in the 19.3 activities directory, the class notes. 
The class material from 19.3 wasn't sufficient for me to finish this assignment. 19.3 dealt with mostly images. 

#### I also got some help from chatGPT for training the model since I was getting some errors due to tensorflow sparse matrix. I needed some debugging help and code help. 

#### Thank You.
